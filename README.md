This is a project I'm making to generate terminal prompts (Primarily designed for Linux, if it works elsewhere then cool but it's not a priority.)
First GitHub project :)
### Project goals:
- Make a working, configurable terminal prompt generator
- Get YAML config support
- Get 256-colour, 16-colour, non-Nerd Font and (if possible) non-Unicode support (auto-detected if possible)
- Make a CLI configurator that generates the config file
- Make a GUI equivalent
